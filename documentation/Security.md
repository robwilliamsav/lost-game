# Security Considerations

This document outlines security considerations for the Lost Game project.

## Overview

The Lost Game is a client-side web application with no server dependencies, external APIs, or user data collection. Security focus is on preventing XSS attacks, ensuring safe input handling, and maintaining game integrity while acknowledging the inherent limitations of client-side security.

## Security Architecture

### Client-Side Only Design
- **Advantage**: No server attack vectors or database vulnerabilities
- **Advantage**: No user authentication or personal data handling
- **Limitation**: Game state can be modified by knowledgeable users
- **Limitation**: No server-side validation of game actions

### No External Dependencies
- **Advantage**: Zero third-party library vulnerabilities
- **Advantage**: No CDN or external resource dependencies
- **Advantage**: Complete control over all code execution

## Current Security Posture

### ✅ Implemented Protections

1. **Input Validation**
   - Keyboard input is limited to specific game controls
   - Movement boundaries are enforced (`lost.html:306-307`)
   - Resource requirements validated before actions (`lost.html:932-955`)
   - Terrain suitability checked for building placement

2. **Safe DOM Manipulation**
   - Game content rendered via `innerHTML` with controlled data (`lost.html:283`)
   - No user-generated content insertion
   - CSS classes used for styling, not inline styles
   - No `eval()` or dynamic code execution

3. **Game State Integrity**
   - Consistent state validation across all actions
   - Boundary checking prevents array out-of-bounds access
   - Resource counters cannot go negative through validation

4. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks around input handling (`lost.html:924-968`)
   - Graceful failure handling for invalid actions
   - Console error logging for debugging

### ⚠️ Identified Security Considerations

1. **Client-Side State Manipulation**
   - **Risk**: Users can modify game variables via browser console
   - **Impact**: Cheating, resource manipulation, objective bypassing
   - **Mitigation**: Accept as inherent limitation of client-side games
   - **Note**: Game is single-player entertainment, not competitive

2. **Local Code Injection**
   - **Risk**: Browser extensions could modify game behavior
   - **Impact**: Altered gameplay experience
   - **Mitigation**: No practical mitigation possible
   - **Note**: User's own environment, not a security vulnerability

3. **Content Security Policy**
   - **Current**: No CSP headers implemented
   - **Risk**: Potential for injected content (theoretical)
   - **Recommendation**: Implement CSP headers if hosting on web server

## Hosting Security Recommendations

### For Web Server Deployment

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### HTTPS Deployment
- **Required**: Always serve over HTTPS in production
- **Reason**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Reason**: Required for modern browser features

## Code Analysis Results

### Safe Practices Identified

1. **No Dynamic Code Execution**
   - No `eval()`, `Function()`, or `setTimeout()` with strings
   - All code is statically defined

2. **Controlled User Input**
   - Only keyboard events accepted
   - Input mapped to specific game functions
   - No text input fields or user content

3. **Memory Management**
   - Arrays properly managed with cleanup
   - No memory leaks from event listeners
   - Bounded data structures prevent memory exhaustion

### Potential Improvements

1. **Input Sanitization Enhancement**
   ```javascript
   // Current: Direct key mapping
   if (e.key.toLowerCase() == 'b') { actionBridge(); }
   
   // Improvement: Whitelist validation
   const allowedKeys = ['b', 'c', 'w', 'g', 't', 'e'];
   if (allowedKeys.includes(e.key.toLowerCase())) { /* process */ }
   ```

2. **State Validation**
   ```javascript
   // Add periodic integrity checks
   function validateGameState() {
       if (wood < 0) wood = 0;
       if (stone < 0) stone = 0;
       if (food < 0) food = 0;
       // Additional validations
   }
   ```

## Threat Model

### In-Scope Threats
1. ✅ Malicious web hosting (mitigated by HTTPS requirement)
2. ✅ Cross-site scripting (mitigated by no user input)
3. ✅ Code injection (mitigated by no dynamic execution)

### Out-of-Scope Threats
1. ❌ Client-side cheating (accepted limitation)
2. ❌ Browser extension interference (user's environment)
3. ❌ Local file system access (browser sandbox)

## Security Testing

### Manual Testing Performed ✅
- Keyboard input validation
- Boundary condition testing
- Error handling verification
- DOM manipulation safety

### Recommended Additional Testing
- [ ] Automated security scanning
- [ ] Browser compatibility security testing
- [ ] Performance/DoS testing with rapid inputs
- [ ] CSP implementation testing

## Incident Response Plan

### For Security Issues
1. **Assessment**: Determine impact and exploit potential
2. **Containment**: Update code to fix vulnerability
3. **Communication**: Update documentation and notify users if needed
4. **Prevention**: Add safeguards to prevent similar issues

### Contact Information
- See project repository for issue reporting
- Security issues should be reported via GitHub issues

## Compliance Considerations

### Privacy
- ✅ No personal data collection
- ✅ No cookies or tracking
- ✅ No analytics or telemetry
- ✅ GDPR compliant by default

### Accessibility
- ⚠️ Consider keyboard navigation standards
- ⚠️ Screen reader compatibility
- ⚠️ Color contrast requirements
