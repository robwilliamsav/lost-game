  - Smooth transitions between dawn, day, dusk, and night
  - Ambient light levels vary throughout the day
  
- **Dynamic Light Sources**: Interactive lighting that affects gameplay visibility
  - Player torch with 8-tile radius warm orange glow
  - Camp lights providing 6-tile radius safe zones
  - Fire lights with intense 10-tile radius illumination
  - Light intensity falloff based on distance
  
- **Advanced Color Blending**: Sophisticated lighting calculations
  - Screen blend mode for additive light effects
  - Multiply blend for darkness application
  - Real-time color mixing based on multiple light sources
  - Performance-optimized selective rendering

### Technical Implementation
- Color manipulation functions: hexToRgb, rgbToHex, screenBlend, multiplyBlend
- Light source management system with updateLightSources()
- Modified rendering pipeline to apply per-tile lighting calculations
- Time-based ambient lighting with dawn/day/dusk/night phases

## [1.0.1] - 2025-06-22

### Changed - UI/UX Improvements
- **Fullscreen Layout**: Game now utilizes entire browser viewport for immersive experience
  - Body overflow hidden to prevent page scrolling
  - Game area dynamically sized using calc(100vh - 120px)
  - Flexbox layout for responsive fullscreen display
  - Side panels maintain fixed width with scrollable content

- **Keyboard Navigation Fix**: Arrow keys no longer trigger browser scrolling
  - Added preventDefault() to arrow key and space bar events
  - Ensures smooth gameplay without page movement
  - Improves user experience for keyboard-based navigation

- **Header Layout Optimization**: Logo, focus text, and score now on single line
  - Created flexbox header container for better space utilization
  - Focus text centered between logo and score
